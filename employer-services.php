              <p>
                IMC provides advantages by saving both the business and employee time and money. Encouraging employees to use immediate care over the ER results in lower co-pays for faster care by physician-led team. Employers can benefit from lower health insurance premiums when employees utilize IMC since claims are processed at a lower cost than traditional ER fees.
