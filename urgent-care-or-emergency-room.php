                      Choosing between emergency room care and urgent care is an important decision with many factors involved. Immediate Medical Care is an ideal alternative to costly, time-consuming emergency room visits for non-life threatening situations that require urgent care. Additionally, if your primary care physician is closed or unavailable, Immediate Medical Care can treat any issue you’d normally see your doctor for.

                      Operated on a walk-in basis, wait-times are kept to a minimum, and no appointment is ever needed. On top of keeping yourself out of an emergency room with a long wait time, you’ll be helping emergency rooms by making room for people coming in with more serious, life-threatening situations.

                    <p>
                      Urgent care facilities can be thought of as robust, highly-equipped physicians’ offices with extended hours and freedom from set appointment times.

                      Emergency room co-pays and deductibles are often much higher than those you’d pay at an urgent care facility, such as Immediate Medical Care. Often, you’ll only need to pay the co-pay your insurance requires for a typical doctor’s office visit.
